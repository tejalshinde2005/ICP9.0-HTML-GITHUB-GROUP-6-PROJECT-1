<br>
<p>For those with gluten intolerance, having a plate of pasta or noodles <br> is a tenuous option. Most pasta is made from wheat, <br> whereas wheat-free or gluten-free types turn out  <br>to be poor mushy and unpalatable relatives of <br> its wheat-made variants.

    However, Asian cuisine does offer <br> a whole host of gluten-free noodles with <br> ingredients such as rice, sweet potatoes, <br> and mung beans. These noodle variants might not have the same <br> taste and texture as wheat-based pasta or noodles, <br> but it brings its own delectable flavour to the dish.</p>
